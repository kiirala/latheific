Latheific!
==========

Latheific is a demo project by Niko Kiirala. Original plan was to make a 4k
intro for Instanssi 2012.

This project includes small lathe code (it creates circular objects from an
outline. Something like a wine glass, a bowl or a soda bottle). The
initialization code is, at the moment, much too large to be used in any
serious 4k intro, but it's good for developing and should be quite easy to
swap for a more serious one.

Building:
It should be sufficient to just run
$ make
You may get error about missing executable 'sstrip'. If that happens, you need
the 'ELF kickers' package. Alternatively you may run
$ make latheific
to build just the unpacked version.

SDL and OpenGL libraries are required.
